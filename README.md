## 📖 Description
This code imports random and ursina from ursina import *. It creates a class called Bacteria(Button) with genetic code letters and a DNA variable. The class is initialized with a global variable and a DNA variable. The code then updates the bacteria variable based on the randomness of the genes. The bacteria variable is then added to the bacteria list.

## 🚀 Features
The description includes features such as importing random modules, inheriting a bacteria class from the button class, initializing global variables, implementing gene randomization, and adding new bacteria objects to a bacteria list. It suggests the use of `ursina` in a 3D or interactive environment for simulation or visual representation of genetic processes. Assistance is available for refining or troubleshooting the code.
